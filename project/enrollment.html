</div>

<ol class="mx-32 my-12"><br>
    <li class="">1. Talk with your local school district to discuss New Hope Educational Complex as an option for your child.</li><br>
    <li>2. Gather your child's school records, specifically your child's most recent IEP (Individualized Education Program), assessments and reports.</li><br>
    <li>3. Call our Admissions department to schedule a tour of Hope Academy with our Intake Coordinator to view our program and discuss your child's
        needs and review your child's records.
    </li><br>
    <li>4. If you, your local school district and our Intake Coordinator feel New Hope Educational Complex may be a good fit for your child, 
        your child is then scheduled for a 2 day visit at New Hope.  Your child will experience time with our teachers,
        clinicians and student population. Informal assessments are completed.  After your child's 2 day visit, our intake
        team will either make a recommendation for your child to attend New Hope Educational or make a referral to another program
        that may be more appropriate for your child.
    </li><br>
    <li>6. When your child is eligible to be enrolled into New Hope, we will collaborate with you (parents or guardians) and your
        local school district to design and implement the most appropriate Individualized Education Program for your child.
